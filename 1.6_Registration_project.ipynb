It consists of 30 traverse slices of MR brain scans with two different sequences: T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR (5 patients $\\times$ 3 slices per patient $\\times$ 2 modalities).

The report must be submitted as a single PDF file. The code must be submitted as a single archive file (e.g. zip or 7z) that is self-contained and can be used to reproduce the results in the report. \n",

The image filenames have the following format: `{Patient ID}_{Slice ID}_{Sequence}.tif`. For example, the filename `3_2_t1.tif` is the second slice from a T1-weighted scan of the third patient. Every T1 slice comes in two versions: original and transformed with some random transformation that can be identified with the `_d` suffix in the filename. This simulates a registration problem where you have to register two image acquisitions of the same patient (note however that some of the transformations that were used to simulate the second set of images are not realistic for brain imaging, e.g. brain scans typically do not encounter shearing between consecutive acquisitions).\n",
